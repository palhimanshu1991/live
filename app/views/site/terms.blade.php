            Hi! You are now reading Berdict's Terms of Service, meaning the contract between you and Berdict when you use Berdict's site, services, and products. You should read this carefully before you use Berdict. We've tried to be fair and straightforward. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to email us. We've also included several annotations; these annotations aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and emphasize key sections.

                    <h2>1. Accepting the Terms of Service</h2>

                    <p>
                        Please read these Terms of Service, our <a href="http://localhost/mmp/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and our Community Guidelines (collectively, the "<b>Agreement</b>") carefully before using Berdict.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and/or the other domains, products, services, and/or content provided by Berdict, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site, the "<b>Services</b>") (Berdict, Inc., a Delaware corporation, collectively with its agents, consultants, employees, officers and directors, "<b>Berdict</b>," "<b>we</b>," or "<b>us</b>"). By using or accessing the Services, you ("<b>Subscriber</b>" or "<b>you</b>") agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't and aren't permitted to use the Services.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Modifications to this Agreement</h2>

                    <p>
                        Berdict reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Agreement at any time by posting a revised Agreement through the Services and by providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via e-mail where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification in your Berdict Dashboard). You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement. Modifications are effective when posted, and your use of the Services following any such posted modification and notice of same constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified. Note that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below) prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time Berdict received your prepayment.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">As Berdict grows and improves, we might have to make changes to the Terms of Service. When we do, we'll let you know. We're also going to make it a practice to post old versions so it's easy to see changes/additions/deletions. To see old versions, scroll down to the end of this document.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2>3. Use of the Services</h2>

                    <h3>Eligibility:</h3>

                    <p>
                        No individual under the age of thirteen (13) may use the Services or provide any information to Berdict or otherwise through the Services (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address). You otherwise may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract with Berdict and are not legally prohibited from using the Services.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">You have to be at least 13 years old to use Berdict. We're serious: it's a hard rule, based on U.S. federal and state legislation, even if you're 12.9 years old. If you're younger than 13, don't use Berdict. Ask your parents for an Xbox or try books.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Service Changes and Limitations:</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. Berdict retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Berdict may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. Berdict may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below). Berdict may also suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">This section makes it clear that Berdict is an ever-evolving platform. With new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that flop). We can also suspend any individual account at any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our <a href="http://localhost/mmp/privacy" "="">Privacy Policy</a>, and our Community Guidelines.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Limitations on Automated Use:</h3>

                    <p>
                        You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (a) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Berdict and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Berdict (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Berdict, or unless permitted by Berdict's robots.txt file or other robot exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape Content (as defined below) from the Services, without Berdict's express prior written consent; (e) use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or e-mail headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">Don't do bad things to Berdict or other users. Some particularly egregious examples of automated "bad things" are listed in this section.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <h2>4. Registration, Berdict URLs, and Security</h2>

                    <p>
                        As a condition to using certain of the Services, you may be required to create an account (an "<b>Account</b>") and select a password and Berdict username, which will serve as a default URL of the form [username].Berdict.com (a "Berdict URL"). You may also select new Berdict URLs for each blog you create.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You should provide Berdict with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly your e-mail address, and failure to do so may result in suspension of your Account.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">It's really important that the email address associated with your Berdict Account is accurate and up-to-date. If you ever forget your password - or worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address is often the only way for us to recover your account.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        You agree that you shall not select or use as a Berdict URL a name of another person or entity with the intent to impersonate that person or entity or with the intent to otherwise cause confusion as to the origin or provenance of your Account. Berdict reserves the right to refuse registration of, cancel, or modify a Berdict URL in its sole discretion.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">Don't choose a Berdict URL with the intention of impersonating someone/something or otherwise causing confusion about who's behind your blog. Parody, criticism, and other fair uses of others' names are fine, so long as there's no intention to impersonate or confuse.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify Berdict immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Privacy</h2>

                    <p>
                        Any information you provide to Berdict is subject to Berdict's <a href="http://localhost/mmp/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>6. Content and Subscriber Content</h2>

                    <h3>Definitions:</h3>

                    <p>
                        For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term "<b>Content</b>" means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies, and comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, Themes (as defined below), and interactive features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services; (2) the term "<b>Subscriber Content</b>" is all Content that is posted or otherwise provided or transferred to the Services by a Subscriber (including, without limitation, by you); and Content also includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ownership:</h3>

                    <p>
                        Subscribers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in their Subscriber Content, and Berdict and/or third parties retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in all Content other than Subscriber Content.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">You retain ownership of any intellectual property you post to Berdict.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Subscriber Content License to Berdict:</h3>

                    <p>
                        When you transfer Subscriber Content to Berdict through the Services, you give Berdict a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative works of (including, without limitation, by Reblogging, as defined below), such Subscriber Content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating the Services in accordance with their functionality, improving the Services, and allowing Berdict to develop new Services. The reference in this license to "derivative works" is not intended to give Berdict itself a right to make substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does enable Berdict Subscribers to redistribute Subscriber Content from one Berdict blog to another in a manner that allows Subscribers to, e.g., add their own text or other Content before or after your Subscriber Content ("<b>Reblogging</b>").
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">
                        <p>
                            When you upload your creations to Berdict, you grant us a license to make that content available in the ways you'd expect from using our services (for example, via your blog, RSS, the Berdict Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do anything with your content that surprises you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Something else worth noting: Countless Berdict blogs have gone on to spawn books, films, albums, brands, and more. We're thrilled to offer our support as a platform for our creators, and we'd never claim to be entitled to royalties or reimbursement for the success of what you've created. It's your work, and we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        You also agree that this license includes the right for Berdict to make all publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Berdict, so that those third parties can distribute and/or analyze such Content on other media and services.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">An example of what it means to "make all publicly-posted Content available" to a Berdict partner for distribution or analysis would be if we licensed a feed of already-publicly-available Content to a partner, similar to how Twitter makes feeds available through its <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/methods">Streaming API</a>.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through the Services - when you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a social conversation that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others.
                    </p><div class="annotation inside">One thing you should consider before posting: When you make something publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all copies of it.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        You also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of others, and represent that you have all of the necessary rights to grant us this license for all Subscriber Content you submit to the Services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Content License to You:</h3>

                    <p>
                        As a Subscriber of the Services, Berdict grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download, store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create derivative works of Content solely in connection with your use of, and in accordance with the functionality and restrictions of, the Services (including, without limitation, Paid Services, as defined below). This means, for example, that we license Content to you so that you can Reblog Content and add commentary to it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Compliance with Community Guidelines:</h3>

                    <p>
                        You agree that you won't post Subscriber Content that violates, or otherwise use your Account in ways that violate, Berdict's <a href="/community_guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Termination and Deletion:</h3>

                    <p>
                        On termination of your Account or upon your deletion of particular pieces of Subscriber Content from the Services, Berdict shall make reasonable efforts to make such Subscriber Content inaccessible and cease use of it; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to the Subscriber Content may not be immediately removed; (b) such removed Subscriber Content may persist in backups (not available to others) for a reasonable period of time; and (c) such removed Subscriber Content may be available (and stored on our servers) through the accounts of other Subscribers, such as because of Reblogging.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Special Provisions for Application Developers</h2>

                    <p>
                        If you develop software or services based on the Services or any Content, whether using the <a href="http://www.Berdict.com/developers">Berdict Application Programming Interface</a> or not, you will agree to and comply with the <a href="/policy/en/api">Berdict Application Developer and API License Agreement</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>8. Use of Trademarks</h2>

                    <p>
                        Any use of Berdict's trademarks, branding, logos and other such assets in connection with the Services shall be in accordance with the <a href="http://www.Berdict.com/policy/en/trademark">Berdict Trademark Guidelines</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>9. Blog Themes</h2>

                    <p>
                        Berdict makes available specialized HTML and CSS code ("<b>Berdict Template Code</b>") for the design and layout of blog pages available for use on some of the Services ("<b>Themes</b>"). Certain Themes are available for purchase as a Paid Service (as defined below) (such Themes, "<b>Premium Themes</b>"). Purchased Premium Themes may not be transferred between Accounts, between blogs, or between Services on a single Account and are subject to the payment terms herein.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Berdict grants you a license to customize the Berdict Template Code to create your own Themes for use on your blog page (each a "<b>Custom Theme</b>"). If you choose, you may also contribute your Custom Themes for use by other Subscribers as Subscriber Content. However, as a condition of the license allowing you to create Custom Themes, you agree that you won't distribute such Custom Themes from locations other than Berdict-owned or approved websites without our permission, as set out in our <a href="/community_guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note also that other Subscribers may use your Custom Themes after you have removed them from distribution, and you hereby grant those Subscribers an irrevocable license to use those Custom Themes as contributed by you. In other words, you can remove and stop distribution of your Custom Themes, but Subscribers who are already using them can keep using them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To develop and distribute Custom Themes that are Premium Themes, please <a href='javascript:help_modal.show({"type":"support"}); //'>email us</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>10. Paid Services</h2>

                    <p>
                        Some of the Services require payment of fees (the "<b>Paid Services</b>," including without limitation Premium Themes). All fees are stated in United States dollars. You shall pay all applicable fees, as described in the applicable Services, in connection with such Services, and any related taxes or additional charges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Paid Services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay aspects of the Services. Usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or similar terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use Paid Services, and do not represent any transfer of any right, title, or ownership interest of any kind. You may not relicense, resell, transfer, or exchange Paid Services within or outside of the Services, except as expressly allowed by the rules of the Services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Berdict may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or eliminate, Paid Services, or the terms and conditions under which Paid Services are provided.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Purchases of Paid Services are final and non-refundable (particularly those Paid Services that may be used immediately, such as Promotions, as defined below), except at Berdict's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each such Paid Service. Termination of your Account or your rights under this Agreement may result in forfeiture of existing Paid Services. For example, if your Account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any Premium Themes you have purchased.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Berdict may change its prices for Paid Services at any time. To the extent applicable, Berdict will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Service and/or by sending you email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable Paid Service prior to the change going into effect.
                    </p>

                    <h2>11. Special Provisions for Promotions</h2>

                    <p>
                        Some features of the Services may allow you to promote yourself to other Subscribers, and some of these features may be Paid Services ("<b>Promotions</b>"). For example, you can use Berdict's Highlighted Post Paid Service to draw extra attention to your posts when they appear in the Dashboard feeds of your blog followers.

                    </p><div class="annotation inside">This section covers the rules and sets some expectations around paid <i>promotion</i> features like Movie Promotion and Highlighted Reviews.</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                        The following additional terms apply to Promotions:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Things that you promote will comply with this Agreement; if they don't, Berdict reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel a Promotion without refund or recourse to you.</li>
                        <li>Berdict may remove or disable any Promotion for any reason in its sole discretion.</li>
                        <li>Berdict does not guarantee any activity that Promotions may receive, including but not limited to clicks, Likes, and Reblogs. Berdict cannot control how Subscribers interact with Promotions and is not responsible for "click fraud" or other fraudulent actions by third parties, including, without limitation, Subscribers. Berdict doesn't guarantee that its reporting related to Promotions will be accurate or complete, nor does it guarantee that Promotions will behave in a particular manner, and Berdict shall not be liable to you or responsible for any erroneous reporting about or errant behavior of or related to Promotions (e.g., any errors in how "likes" or Reblogs are counted).</li>
                        <li>Promotions may allow targeting to some Subscriber characteristics, such as by suggesting new blogs to follow based on currently followed blogs. Berdict does not guarantee that any particular Promotion will reach a particular sort of individual in all cases.</li>
                        <li>You can cancel certain Promotions at any time (depending on their functionality), but are responsible for paying for Promotions at least to the extent they have already been distributed through the Services.</li>
                        <li>By submitting a Promotion, you license Berdict to run that Promotion for as long as you have specified, which, depending on the Promotion, may be perpetually. This license ends when the Promotion has completed or been cancelled, but it may take up to twenty four (24) hours before a Promotion stops being reflected on the Services.</li>

                    <h3>Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:
                    </p>

                        <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including its location, with sufficient detail so that Berdict is capable of finding it and verifying its existence.</li>
                        <li>Contact information for the notifying party (the "<b>Notifying Party</b>"), including name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.</li>
                        <li>A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.</li>
                        <li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Berdict will immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. Berdict reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any Subscriber who is the subject of repeated DMCA notifications.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may file a counter-notification with Berdict by providing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The specific URLs of material that Berdict has removed or to which Berdict has disabled access.</li>
                        <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
                        <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.</li>
                        <li>The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."</li>
                        <li>Your signature.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Berdict will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Berdict does not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services.
